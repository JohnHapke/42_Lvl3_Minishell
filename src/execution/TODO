1. bool is_child in execution -> case: when execve is not working but we are in the child process, then we have to exit manually
2. return of functions with int and control in execution handler
	2.1 control paths of return and usage of ERROR_... or EXIT_SUCCESS (makes it more clearly)
	2.2 execution handler can stay as a void to do cleanup afterwards in parser


-> idea!! : We could implement it like I am doing it right now with the pointer of shell->exit_status but we also could build the returns 
safe until the shell loop and change the parsing_handler to an int and return the exit_status
	-> shell->exit_status = parsing_handler(...);
